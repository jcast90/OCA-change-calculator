####Astro Weight Calculator########

In this JavaScript project I had to build an internal tool that will calculate the users weight depending on what planet they are on. Each planet has it's own value to run a conversion on to calculate the users weight. I also had to add functionality to remove Pluto as a planet, as well as, give the user the ability to add or create their own planet with a given value and convert their weight based on that value.
